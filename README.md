If you are like me and don't like to play "Find 5 differences" in your GitHub PR images, then this extension is just for you. Because: 
- It adds additional image comparer to the GitHub PR file preview that shows what pixels changed so you can easily spot the difference.
- You can open original, changed and diff images in a preview dialog for better comparison.
- There is also settings menu that allows you to make this comparer as a default one and change the threshold.
